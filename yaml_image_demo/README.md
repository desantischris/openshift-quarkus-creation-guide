# Item 2: YAML-Based Nginx Deployment

Demonstrate manual resource creation with YAML manifests.

- Used non-root image for OpenShift compatibility
- Added health checks on port 8080
- Scaled replicas
- Exposed via Route






## Overview
In this tutorial, the user will:
1. Deploy sample Quarkus app via the console catalog.
2. Add readiness/liveness health checks to ensure stability.
3. Expose the app publicly with a Route.
4. Manually scaled replicas from 1 → 3 to demonstrate horizontal scaling and self-healing.
5. Trigger a new source-to-image build and verified rolling update across all pods.
6, Monitor via the Observe tab.

## Steps
1. In the Red Hat Developer Sandbox (https://sandbox.redhat.com/), select the **+** sign in the header at the top right of the page.
    - Select **Import from YAML**
    - Paste in the following code and click **Create**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-yaml-demo
  labels:
    app: nginx-yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2

          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 30
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "50m"
              memory: "64Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "200m"
              memory: "128Mi"

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-yaml-service
  labels:
    app: nginx-yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-yaml
  ports:

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: nginx-yaml-route
  labels:
    app: nginx-yaml
spec:
  # Optional: you can omit 'host' and let OpenShift generate one
  # host: nginx-yaml-demo.apps.<your-sandbox-domain>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: nginx-yaml-service
  port:
    targetPort: http
```

2. The app, service, and route are created and a build is initiated.
    - Navigate to **Workloads > Topology** and view the new app

3. After a few minutes, click the **Route** link in the app properties window.
    - View the Nginx web server welcome page
    - Note: clicking the link too early may generate an error as the backend pods were not yet running and the service endpoints may not exist. The page may cache and not load even when the pods are online and service endpoints exist. A hard refresh may clear the issue. The command ```curl http://nginx-yaml-service:8080/``` can be run inside the pod terminal to determine if the Nginx route is available.
