# Item 2: YAML-Based Nginx Deployment

This project demonstrates creating a complete application stack — Deployment, Service, and Route — entirely from raw YAML  in the OpenShift console without using the catalog wizard.

# Key Features & Learnings
- Manual resource creation: All components defined in a single YAML file for full control.
- OpenShift compatibility: Used the non-root image nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1-alpine to satisfy Security Context Constraints (SCCs). OpenShift blocks root containers for security purposes causing the standard Nginx image to fail. Using a non-root version makes the deployment work smoothly.
- Reliability: Configured readiness and liveness probes on port 8080 (path /) to ensure pods are marked Ready and traffic is routed correctly.
- Public exposure: Created a Route to make the application accessible externally and verified the standard Nginx welcome page.

This approach is common for custom or advanced deployments in enterprise environments.

## Steps
1. In the Red Hat Developer Sandbox (https://sandbox.redhat.com/), select the **+** sign in the header at the top right of the page.
    - Select **Import from YAML**
    - Paste in the following code and click **Create**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-yaml-demo
  labels:
    app: nginx-yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-yaml
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1-alpine

          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 30
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "50m"
              memory: "64Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "200m"
              memory: "128Mi"

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:

  labels:
    app: nginx-yaml

    app: nginx-yaml

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route

  # Optional: you can omit 'host' and let OpenShift generate one
  # host: nginx-yaml-demo.apps.<your-sandbox-domain>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: nginx-yaml-service
  port:
    targetPort: http
```

2. The app, service, and route are created and a build is initiated.
    - Navigate to **Workloads > Topology** and view the new app

3. After a few minutes, click the **Route** link in the app properties window.
    - View the Nginx web server welcome page
    - Note: clicking the link too early may generate an error as the backend pods were not yet running and the service endpoints may not exist. The page may cache and not load even when the pods are online and service endpoints exist. A hard refresh may clear the issue. The command ```curl http://nginx-yaml-service:8080/``` can be run inside the pod terminal to determine if the Nginx route is available.
