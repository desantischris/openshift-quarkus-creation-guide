# Item 2: YAML-Based Nginx Deployment

This project demonstrates creating a complete application stack — Deployment, Service, and Route — entirely from raw YAML  in the OpenShift console without using the catalog wizard.

# Key Features & Learnings
- Manual resource creation: All components defined in a single YAML file for full control.
- OpenShift compatibility: Used the non-root image nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1-alpine to satisfy Security Context Constraints (SCCs). OpenShift blocks root containers for security purposes causing the standard Nginx image to fail. Using a non-root version makes the deployment work smoothly.
- Reliability: Configured readiness and liveness probes on port 8080 (path /) to ensure pods are marked Ready and traffic is routed correctly.
- Public exposure: Created a Route to make the application accessible externally and verified the standard Nginx welcome page.

This approach is common for custom or advanced deployments in enterprise environments.

## Source YAML
Full manifest used for deployment: [source_yaml/source.yaml](source_yaml/source.yaml)

## Generated + Enhanced YAML
Exported Deployment after adding health checks: [generated_yaml/](generated_yaml/)
generated-yaml/deployment.yaml

## Steps
1. In the Red Hat Developer Sandbox (https://sandbox.redhat.com/), select the **+** sign in the header at the top right of the page.
    - Select **Import from YAML**
    - Paste in the code in [source_yaml/source.yaml](source_yaml/source.yaml) and click **Create**

2. The app, service, and route are created.
    - Navigate to **Workloads > Topology** and view the new app

3. After a few minutes, click the **Route** link in the app properties window.
    - View the Nginx web server welcome page
    - Note: Clicking the Route link too early may show an error as the backend pods are not yet ready and Service endpoints don't exist yet. The page may cache and not load even when the pods are online and service endpoints exist. A hard refresh may clear the issue. The command ```curl http://nginx-yaml-service:8080/``` can be run inside the pod terminal to determine if the Nginx route is available.
